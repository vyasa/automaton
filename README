This project is intended as a group project for the Clarkson Open Source
Institute. We just wanted something to get together and hack on. Our goal is
to create a high-quality piece of software which is elegant, concise, and
maintainable. We hope to improve ourselves and our craft by committing to the
development of software which exemplifies our ideals, whether technical,
political, or social.
